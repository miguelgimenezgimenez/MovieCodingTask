# IMG CODE TEST
Simple Movie Search App using the Movie Database API.

The state Management of the App is done using *redux*, asynchronous actions are handled by middleware *redux-thunk*.


The UI theme is based on Atom's hipster theme.Reused from one of the first apps I made (thought it was stylish at the time).


Auto complete Search Bar is done using react toolbox.


#### Note to the reviewer 

_sorry for the overkill, I know this isnt exactly what was being asked for, but I thought I might add some features. Have worked on it really fast and maybe ended up a bit messy . Also . just realized that wanting to optimize performance I did it in a way that tried to avoid re rendering of components but it didnt work the way i  wanted it to , but now i understand react a lot better_
