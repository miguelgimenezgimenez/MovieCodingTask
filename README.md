# IMG CODE TEST
Simple Movie Search App using the Movie Database API.
The state Management of the App is done using *redux*, asynchronous actions are handled by middleware *redux-thunk*.
The UI theme is based on Atom's hipster theme.Liked those colors but results aren't that stylish.
Auto complete Search Bar is done using react toolbox.
I have tried to optimize performance trying to avoid useless re-rendering (


#### Note to the reviewer 

_sorry for the overkill, I know this isnt exactly what was being asked for, but I thought I might add some features. Have worked on it really fast and maybe ended up a bit messy_






To runn the App

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) in a browser.
